## Features

- Accepts wearable data (e.g., steps, heart rate, sleep hours, HRV, etc.).
- Normalizes the metrics using Min-Max scaling.
- Provides normalized data via an API endpoint.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework for API development.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and normalization.
- **JSON**: For data input and output.
